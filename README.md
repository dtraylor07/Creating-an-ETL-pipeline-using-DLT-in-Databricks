This code repository contains sample code for users to create an ETL pipeline using Delta Live Tables in Databricks. The code utilizes the medallion architecture with a bronze layer, silver layer, and gold layer. The code also provides basic sql commands that users can use to view their data and see the different transformations from layer to layer. 

In order to get the best use out of this code, it is important for users to understand the SQL language and Databricks notebooks. Users must already have a Databricks Workspace up and running with permissions to create a cluster. Users must also have permissions to save data to the DBFS or cloud object storage.
